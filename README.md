# Network-Simulator

End-to-end device network simulator using Java.

## Overview

The Network-Simulator is a Java-based application designed to simulate network devices and their interactions. This tool provides a platform to model, test, and analyze network behaviors in a controlled environment.

## Features

- **Device Simulation**: Emulates various network devices to study their behaviors and interactions.
- **Routing**: Implements routing mechanisms to simulate data flow between devices.
- **User Interface**: Provides a graphical user interface for easy configuration and visualization of the network topology and data routes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkashDeore15/Network-Simulator.git
   cd Network-Simulator
   ```

2. **Compile the Source Code**:
   ```bash
   javac NetworkSimulator.java NetworkSimulatorUI.java
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   java NetworkSimulator
   ```

## Usage

Upon launching the application:

- **Add Devices**: Use the interface to add various network devices to the simulation.
- **Configure Routes**: Set up routing paths between devices to define data flow.
- **Visualize Network**: The UI provides a visual representation of the network topology and active routes.
- **Simulate Traffic**: Generate and monitor network traffic to analyze device interactions and performance.
